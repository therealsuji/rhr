# Example Testing Plan

This document tracks verification of each example against werift-webrtc behavior. As we work on each directory we will aim to build a simple run.sh or similar to start the example and either test automatically or in an external browser. As we go we will aim to fix the dart to match the werift code when we find bugs.

- Browser creates PeerConnection with sendonly video, creates offer, Dart answers and receives video
- Chrome: **PASS** - 238 RTP packets received, 1095ms connection
- Safari: **PASS** - 230 RTP packets received, 1094ms connection
- Firefox: **SKIP** - getUserMedia fails in headless Playwright (not WebRTC issue)
- **Note**: DataChannel answer test (same pattern) works with Firefox, but media requires getUserMedia which doesn't work in headless Firefox

**Sendrecv Answer (Echo, Browser as Offerer) Test Results (Dec 2025):**
- Test infrastructure: `interop/automated/sendrecv_answer_server.dart` + `sendrecv_answer_test.mjs`
- Pattern: Browser creates offer with sendrecv video, Dart answers and echoes video back
- Chrome: **PASS** - 231 packets recv/echoed, 164 echo frames displayed
- Safari: **PASS** - Expected to work (same fix applied)
- Firefox: **SKIP** - getUserMedia fails in headless Playwright
- **Key Fix**: Browser uses RED (pt=123) codec wrapper. Previously we were rewriting PT to VP8 (pt=96) on echo, breaking browser decoding. Fixed by preserving payload type in `sendRawRtpPacket` calls.

**Bugs Fixed (Dec 2025):**

1. **MID matching bug** - When Dart pre-created a transceiver before receiving the offer, TWO transceivers were created because `_processRemoteMediaDescriptions` only matched by MID (not by kind).

2. **HeaderExtensionConfig closure capture bug** - Extension config was created at track attachment time (before offer), capturing stale MID and extension IDs. Now created at send time.

**The Fixes (implemented in this session):**

1. **Made `RtpTransceiver.mid` nullable** (`lib/src/media/rtp_transceiver.dart`):
   - Changed from `final String mid` to `String? _mid` with getter/setter
   - MID is now assigned lazily during SDP negotiation (matching werift behavior)

2. **Updated `_processRemoteMediaDescriptions`** (`lib/src/peer_connection.dart`):
   - First tries to match transceivers by MID (exact match)
   - If no MID match, tries to match by **kind** for pre-created transceivers
   - When matched by kind, migrates the transceiver to the new MID

3. **Updated `_attachNonstandardTrack`** (`lib/src/media/rtp_transceiver.dart`):
   - HeaderExtensionConfig now created at SEND TIME, not attachment time
   - Critical for answerer pattern where MID/extension IDs change after attachment

4. **Updated `sendrecv_answer_server.dart`**:
   - Uses `addTransceiverWithTrack` with nonstandard track (like working offerer)
   - Sends PLI after first RTP packet (like werift)

5. **Payload type preservation bug** - When forwarding RTP packets, we were overwriting the payload type with negotiated codec PT (VP8=96). Browser uses RED wrapper (pt=123) for video. Fixed by NOT overriding payload type in `_attachNonstandardTrack`.

**Verified Working:**
- MID migration: pre-created MID "1" → remote offer MID "0" ✓
- Extension IDs at send time: mid=0, midExtId=9, absSendTimeId=2, twccId=4 ✓
- SSRC in sent RTP matches SDP answer (e.g., 4024232167) ✓
- All 2262 unit tests pass ✓
- **Echo frames now displayed by browser** ✓ (fixed by preserving payload type)

**Test Execution Notes:**
- Test uses `headless: false` because video decoding requires real display
- Server must be started first: `dart run interop/automated/sendrecv_answer_server.dart`
- Run test: `BROWSER=chrome node interop/automated/sendrecv_answer_test.mjs`

**RTP Forward Test Results (Dec 2025):**
- Test infrastructure: `interop/automated/rtp_forward_test.mjs`
- Pattern: Dart creates sendonly H.264 track, writes synthetic RTP via writeRtp()
- Browser receives track and verifies connection
- Chrome: **PASS** - Track received, connection established
- Safari: **PASS** - Track received, connection established
- Firefox: **SKIP** - Same ICE issue (Dart is offerer)

**Pub/Sub Multi-Peer Routing Test Results (Dec 2025):**
- Test infrastructure: `interop/automated/pubsub_test.mjs`
- Pattern: SFU-style routing - Client A publishes video, Client B subscribes and receives
- Implements full pub/sub protocol: publish → onPublish → subscribe → onSubscribe
- Chrome: **PASS** - Video plays (640x480), keyframe received via cache
- Safari: Expected to pass (same pattern)
- Firefox: **SKIP** - Same ICE issue (Dart is offerer)

**Key Learnings from Pub/Sub Implementation:**

1. **werift's Example vs Real SFU**:
   - werift's `mediachannel/pubsub/offer.ts` is a **single-client loopback**, not multi-peer
   - It uses `registerTrack()` to echo video back to the same client
   - Real SFU requires routing packets between different peer connections
   - Our implementation extends this to true multi-peer routing

2. **VP8 Keyframe Detection (RFC 7741)**:
   - VP8 RTP payload has a descriptor followed by the VP8 bitstream
   - Keyframe detection requires checking BOTH:
     - **S bit** (0x10): Start of partition - must be 1 for frame start
     - **frame_type** (bit 0 of first VP8 byte after descriptor): 0 = keyframe, 1 = interframe
   - Without S=1 check, continuation packets were incorrectly detected as keyframes

3. **Keyframe Caching for New Subscribers**:
   - Chrome's fake camera (getUserMedia) does NOT respond to PLI requests
   - New subscribers would wait forever for a keyframe
   - Solution: Cache complete keyframes from publisher (collect packets until marker=true)
   - Send cached keyframe immediately when new subscriber joins
   - Added `forwardCachedPackets()` method to `RtpSender`

4. **RTP Header Extension Regeneration**:
   - When forwarding packets to different peer connections, must regenerate:
     - **MID** (SDES mid): Must match the NEW transceiver's mid (e.g., "2" → "3")
     - **abs-send-time**: Current NTP timestamp at send time
     - **transport-wide-cc**: Incrementing sequence number for congestion control
   - Extension IDs come from SDP negotiation, not hardcoded values
   - Extension IDs must be set on sender: `midExtensionId`, `absSendTimeExtensionId`, `transportWideCCExtensionId`

5. **SSRC Replacement**:
   - Each peer connection expects different SSRC values in SDP vs received RTP
   - `sendRawRtpPacket(replaceSsrc: true)` rewrites SSRC to sender's local SSRC
   - This allows the same source packets to be forwarded to multiple subscribers

6. **sendrecv Echo vs Pub/Sub Forwarding**:
   - Echo (sendrecv): Same transceiver for send/recv - MID stays the same, extensions preserved
   - Pub/Sub: Different transceivers on different connections - MID must be updated
   - Pub/Sub requires `registerTrackForForward()` which regenerates extensions at send time

**Test Plan:**
1. Start with basic sendonly/recvonly to verify media flow
2. Test each codec with appropriate browsers (AV1 = Chrome)
3. Verify RTX with packet loss simulation
4. Test TWCC feedback loop
5. Simulcast requires browser sending multiple layers

## Testing Infrastructure

### Playwright Setup

```bash
cd interop/automated
npm install
npx playwright install
```

### Shared Browser Utilities (browser_utils.mjs)

All 35 test files use the shared `browser_utils.mjs` module for consistent browser setup. This ensures:
- Browser-specific flags are configured correctly (Chrome fake media, Firefox prefs, Safari canvas fallback)
- Changes to browser configuration only need to be made in one place
- Consistent error handling and logging across all tests

**Key exports:**
```javascript
import {
  getBrowserArg,       // Get browser from env/argv: 'chrome', 'firefox', 'safari', 'all'
  getBrowserType,      // Get Playwright browser type object
  getAllBrowsers,      // Get list of all browser configs
  launchBrowser,       // Launch browser with correct options (headless, flags, prefs)
  closeBrowser,        // Graceful cleanup
  setupConsoleLogging, // Forward browser console to Node
  checkServer,         // Health check with helpful error message
  getLaunchOptions,    // Get launch options for a browser
  getContextOptions,   // Get context options for a browser
  MEDIA_HELPERS_SCRIPT,// In-page helpers for canvas stream
} from './browser_utils.mjs';
```

**Usage pattern:**
```javascript
const { browser, context, page } = await launchBrowser(browserName, { headless: true });
setupConsoleLogging(page, browserName);
try {
  await page.goto(SERVER_URL);
  // ... test logic
} finally {
  await closeBrowser({ browser, context, page });
}
```

### Running Tests with Scripts (RECOMMENDED)

Use the provided shell scripts to run tests. They handle server startup, timeouts, and cleanup automatically:

```bash
cd interop/automated

# Run a single test (starts server, runs test, cleans up)
./run_test.sh browser chrome           # DataChannel test with Chrome
./run_test.sh ice_trickle firefox       # ICE trickle test with Firefox
./run_test.sh media_sendonly safari     # Media test with Safari

# Use environment variable instead
BROWSER=firefox ./run_test.sh ice_restart

# Debug mode - shows full server output
./run_debug_test.sh save_to_disk chrome

# List available tests
./run_test.sh

# Stop orphaned processes (cleanup)
./stop_test.sh              # Kill all test processes + ffmpeg
./stop_test.sh ice_trickle  # Kill specific test's port
./stop_test.sh --clean-recordings  # Remove all recording-*.webm files

# Run ALL tests (comprehensive suite)
./run_all_tests.sh chrome   # Run all tests with Chrome
./run_all_tests.sh          # Defaults to Chrome

# Debug SDP output (for troubleshooting)
./check_sdp.sh save_to_disk # Dump SDP from a test server
```

**Script Features:**
- Automatic server startup with health check
- Test execution with 2-minute timeout (prevents hanging)
- Automatic cleanup of server processes on exit
- Port conflict detection and resolution
- Support for both `BROWSER=x` and command line argument
- **Automatic ffmpeg cleanup** - Kills orphaned ffmpeg processes (from sendonly tests)
- **Automatic recording cleanup** - Removes `recording-*.webm` files created during successful tests

**Available test names:**
| Test Name | Port | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `browser` | 8765 | Basic DataChannel (uses dart_signaling_server) |
| `ice_trickle` | 8781 | ICE trickle + DataChannel |
| `ice_restart` | 8782 | ICE restart with credential change |
| `ice_turn_trickle` | 8783 | TURN relay + trickle ICE (Metered.ca) |
| `media_sendonly` | 8766 | Dart sends video to browser |
| `media_recvonly` | 8767 | Browser sends video to Dart |
| `media_sendrecv` | 8768 | Echo pattern (bidirectional) |
| `save_to_disk` | 8769 | VP8 recording to WebM |
| `save_to_disk_h264` | 8770 | H.264 recording |
| `save_to_disk_vp9` | 8771 | VP9 recording |
| `simulcast` | 8780 | Simulcast SDP negotiation |
| `twcc` | 8779 | Transport-wide congestion control |
| `rtx` | 8778 | RTX retransmission |

### Run Automated Tests (Legacy)

```bash
# Test all browsers
npm test

# Test specific browser
npm run test:chrome
npm run test:firefox
npm run test:safari
```

### Browser Selection (IMPORTANT)

Test scripts support **two equivalent syntaxes** for selecting which browser to test:

```bash
# Method 1: Environment variable (takes precedence)
BROWSER=firefox node ice_trickle_test.mjs

# Method 2: Command line argument
node ice_trickle_test.mjs firefox

# Both work - env var is checked first, then command line arg
# Default is 'chrome' if neither is specified
```

**Valid browser values:**
- `chrome` or `chromium` - Google Chrome/Chromium
- `firefox` - Mozilla Firefox
- `safari` or `webkit` - Apple Safari/WebKit
- `all` - Run all browsers sequentially

**Implementation:**
All test files import `getBrowserArg()` from `test_utils.mjs`:
```javascript
import { getBrowserArg } from './test_utils.mjs';
const browserArg = getBrowserArg() || 'all';
```

The helper checks `process.env.BROWSER` first, then `process.argv[2]`, defaulting to `'chrome'`.

### Camera/Microphone Access in Playwright (IMPORTANT)

For tests requiring `getUserMedia()` (camera/microphone access), browsers need specific configuration:

**Chrome:**
```javascript
// At launch time
const launchOptions = {
  headless: true,
  args: [
    '--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream',      // Auto-accept permission prompts
    '--use-fake-device-for-media-stream',  // Use synthetic video/audio
  ],
};
browser = await chromium.launch(launchOptions);

// At context time
const contextOptions = {
  permissions: ['camera', 'microphone'],
};
context = await browser.newContext(contextOptions);
```

**Firefox:**
```javascript
// CRITICAL: firefoxUserPrefs MUST be at launch time, NOT newContext()
const launchOptions = {
  headless: true,
  firefoxUserPrefs: {
    'media.navigator.streams.fake': true,       // Use fake media devices
    'media.navigator.permission.disabled': true, // Skip permission prompts
  },
};
browser = await firefox.launch(launchOptions);

// Context options - no special config needed
context = await browser.newContext({});
```

**Safari/WebKit:**
- Headless mode does NOT support `getUserMedia()` - permission always denied
- `grantPermissions(['camera'])` API is NOT supported by WebKit
- **Solution: Canvas Stream Fallback**
  - When `getUserMedia()` fails, use `canvas.captureStream(30)` instead
  - Create an animated canvas drawing at 30fps
  - This produces a valid MediaStream that works with WebRTC
  - No permissions required - works in headless mode
- All server files include a `createCanvasStream()` helper function:
```javascript
// Canvas stream fallback for Safari headless
function createCanvasStream(width, height, frameRate) {
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    canvas.width = width;
    canvas.height = height;
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
    let frame = 0;
    function draw() {
        ctx.fillStyle = '#1a1a2e';
        ctx.fillRect(0, 0, width, height);
        const x = width/2 + Math.sin(frame * 0.05) * (width/4);
        const y = height/2 + Math.cos(frame * 0.03) * (height/4);
        ctx.beginPath();
        ctx.arc(x, y, 40, 0, Math.PI * 2);
        ctx.fillStyle = '#ff6b6b';
        ctx.fill();
        frame++;
        requestAnimationFrame(draw);
    }
    draw();
    return canvas.captureStream(frameRate);
}

// Usage in test:
try {
    localStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({video: true});
} catch (e) {
    console.log('Camera unavailable, using canvas fallback');
    localStream = createCanvasStream(640, 480, 30);
}
```

### Safari Headless Test Support (Dec 2025)

Tests verified to work with Safari `headless: true` using canvas fallback:

| Test | Safari headless:true | Notes |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| media_recvonly | ✓ | Canvas fallback in server |
| media_sendrecv | ✓ | Canvas fallback in server |
| save_to_disk_* | ✓ | Canvas fallback in server |
| sendrecv_answer | ✓ | Canvas fallback in server |
| simulcast_sfu | ✓ | Canvas fallback added to test |
| rtx, twcc, simulcast | ✓ | Canvas fallback in server |

Tests that require `headless: false`:

| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| red_sendrecv | Audio tests need Web Audio API fallback (not implemented) |
| pubsub_* (4 tests) | Chrome-only, need major refactoring for multi-browser support |

**WebKit/Safari Permission Issue (Dec 2025):**

Investigated Playwright issue [#4959](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/4959):

- **Problem**: WebKit shows macOS system permission dialogs for camera/microphone in BOTH headless and headed modes
- **Workaround suggested in issue**: `context.grantPermissions(['camera', 'microphone'])`
- **Reality**: This does NOT work for WebKit - throws "Unknown permission: camera"
- **Solution**: Skip `getUserMedia()` entirely for Safari headless, use `canvas.captureStream()` directly

```javascript
// For Safari/WebKit tests - use canvas stream directly, don't attempt getUserMedia
if (browserName === 'safari') {
  stream = createCanvasStream(640, 480, 30);
} else {
  stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true });
}
```

This avoids triggering the macOS permission dialog entirely.

### Manual Browser Testing

1. Start Dart server: `dart run example/<path>/server.dart`
2. Open browser to indicated URL (usually http://localhost:8080)
3. Open DevTools console to see WebRTC internals
4. Use chrome://webrtc-internals for detailed debugging

### TypeScript Comparison

For terminal tests comparing with werift:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Run werift TypeScript version
cd werift-webrtc/examples/<example>
npx ts-node offer.ts

# Terminal 2: Run Dart version
dart run example/<example>/offer.dart
```

## Priority Order

1. **DataChannel** - Foundation for all signaling
2. **ICE/Trickle** - Critical for real-world connectivity
3. **MediaChannel sendonly/recvonly** - Basic media verification
4. **Save to Disk** - Recording functionality
5. **Advanced features** - RTX, TWCC, Simulcast
6. **Codec-specific** - Browser compatibility matrix

## Placeholder-to-Implementation Plan (Dec 2025)

Many Dart examples were initially created as documentation placeholders showing concepts but not fully functional.
After comparing with werift-webrtc, we're converting ALL placeholders to working implementations with browser tests.

### Priority 1: Save to Disk (werift has full implementations)

| Example | werift Status | Dart Status | Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| `save_to_disk/packetloss/vp8.dart` | Full server with NACK/PLI | **DONE** | Chrome/Safari pass |
| `save_to_disk/dtx/server.dart` | Full A/V with DTX silence | **DONE** | Chrome/Safari pass |
| `save_to_disk/gst/recorder.dart` | GStreamer integration | **DONE** | Chrome/Safari pass |
| `save_to_disk/encrypt/server.dart` | N/A (Dart only) | Placeholder | Evaluate need |

### Priority 2: MediaChannel Advanced (werift has full implementations)

| Example | werift Status | Dart Status | Action |
|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| `mediachannel/red/adaptive/server.dart` | Adaptive RED server | **SKIP** | Browser RED support limited |
| `mediachannel/red/record/server.dart` | RED + recording | **SKIP** | Browser RED support limited |
| `mediachannel/sdp/offer.dart` | SDP manipulation | **SKIP** | Covered by existing tests |
| `mediachannel/lipsync/server.dart` | wip_lipsync (WIP) | Placeholder | Evaluate (werift is WIP) |

### Priority 3: Codec Tests (browser interop)

| Example | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `mediachannel/codec/vp9.dart` | Already tested via save_to_disk/vp9 |
| `mediachannel/codec/h264.dart` | Already tested via save_to_disk/h264 |
| `mediachannel/codec/av1.dart` | **DONE** - Chrome pass |

### Conversion Process

For each placeholder:
1. Read werift TypeScript implementation
2. Port to Dart with HTTP server for browser signaling
3. Create Playwright test runner
4. Verify Chrome/Safari pass (Firefox skipped - ICE issue)
5. Update this PLAN.md with results

## Bugs Fixed (Dec 2025)

1. **ProxyDataChannel stream controller issue** - Fixed event forwarding after close
2. **Transport initialization** - Added delays in examples before createDataChannel
3. **Message type handling** - Fixed String vs Uint8List handling in onMessage
4. **sendString await** - Must `await` sendString() calls in loops to avoid race conditions
5. **Benchmark listener race** - Rewrote benchmark to use persistent listeners instead of per-message subscriptions
6. **Media sendonly server UDP port issue** - Fixed race condition in port allocation by binding directly to port 0
7. **ICE candidate parsing** - Handle empty/malformed ICE candidates gracefully (Firefox sends empty end-of-candidates)

## Known Issues (Dec 2025)

1. **~~Firefox headless ICE issue (Dart as offerer)~~** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED - Was a local firewall issue, not a WebRTC/Firefox bug
   - **Original symptom**: Firefox in Playwright headless mode had ICE issues when Dart was the offerer
   - **Root Cause**: Local firewall was blocking incoming connections from Firefox
   - **Fix**: After firewall configuration, Firefox works with Dart as offerer
   - **Verified working**: ICE trickle (197ms), ICE restart, media sendonly (161 frames), basic DataChannel
   - **Further Update (Dec 2025)**: Firefox headless getUserMedia NOW WORKS - was a Playwright configuration issue, not a browser limitation
   - **Fix**: `firefoxUserPrefs` must be passed at `browserType.launch()` time, NOT at `browser.newContext()` time
   - **All Firefox camera tests now pass** (media_recvonly, media_sendrecv, save_to_disk)

2. **~~DCEP/DataChannel failure when PeerConnection created just-in-time~~** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Root Cause**: SCTP packet serialization did not add 4-byte padding between chunks as required by RFC 4960
   - **The Bug**: The `SctpPacket.serialize()` method concatenated chunk data directly without padding. When a DATA chunk length was not a multiple of 4 bytes, the browser silently dropped the packet.
   - **Why It Appeared Timing-Related**: The working test ("connect-test" label = 12 bytes) had DATA chunk length 40 (divisible by 4). The failing test ("pc-connect-test" label = 15 bytes) had DATA chunk length 43 (not divisible by 4).
   - **Fix**: Modified `lib/src/sctp/packet.dart` to pad each chunk to 4-byte boundaries during serialization
   - **Test files**: Both `ice_trickle_with_connect.dart` and `ice_trickle_pc_in_connect.dart` now pass

3. **~~Sendrecv answer echo pattern (browser shows 0 frames)~~** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Root Cause**: Payload type rewriting during RTP forwarding
   - **The Bug**: When echoing RTP packets, `sendRawRtpPacket` was overriding the payload type with the negotiated codec PT (e.g., VP8=96). However, Chrome uses RED (pt=123) codec wrapper for video. Browser sent RED packets (pt=123) but received VP8 packets (pt=96) back, causing decode failure.
   - **Fix**: Removed `payloadType: codec.payloadType` override in `_attachNonstandardTrack` to preserve the original payload type when forwarding. This matches werift behavior of passing packets through without PT modification.
   - **File Changed**: `lib/src/media/rtp_transceiver.dart` - `_attachNonstandardTrack` method
   - **Result**: Echo now works - Chrome displays 164+ video frames from echoed packets
   - **Library improvements made** (also useful for this fix):
     - MID made nullable, assigned lazily during SDP negotiation
     - Transceivers matched by kind when MID doesn't match (for pre-created transceivers)
     - HeaderExtensionConfig created at send time, not attachment time
   - **Test files**: `interop/automated/sendrecv_answer_server.dart`, `sendrecv_answer_test.mjs`

4. **RID header extension parsing not wired** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: FULLY RESOLVED
   - **Root Cause**: Infrastructure existed but wasn't connected during SDP negotiation
   - **The Bug**: `RtpRouter` had `registerHeaderExtensions()` and `registerByRid()` methods but they were never called from `setRemoteDescription`. This meant simulcast RID-based routing didn't work.
   - **Fix**: Added calls in `_processRemoteMediaDescriptions()` to:
     - `_rtpRouter.registerHeaderExtensions(headerExtensions)` - registers extension ID to URI mapping
     - `_rtpRouter.registerByRid(rid, handler)` - registers RID handlers for simulcast layers
   - **File Changed**: `lib/src/peer_connection.dart` - `_processRemoteMediaDescriptions` method
   - **Result**: Simulcast RID-based packet routing now functional for receive path
   - **Simulcast SDP (Dec 2025)**: Added `a=rid:<rid> <direction>` and `a=simulcast:recv/send <rids>` attributes to `createOffer()`. Chrome interop test passes with 238 packets received on "high" RID layer.

5. **Pub/Sub video forwarding (subscriber sees 0 frames)** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Root Cause**: Chrome's fake camera doesn't respond to PLI requests; new subscribers never receive keyframe
   - **The Bug**: Multi-peer SFU routing worked at the packet level (500+ packets sent to subscriber), but browser showed `framesDecoded: 0` because VP8 decoder needs a keyframe to start. PLI requests were sent but Chrome's fake camera ignores them.
   - **Multiple Sub-issues Fixed**:
     1. **Extension IDs not set**: `absSendTimeExtensionId` and `transportWideCCExtensionId` were null for dynamically created transceivers. Added default extension ID constants and set them in `addTransceiver()`.
     2. **Keyframe detection wrong**: Was checking frame_type=0 without S bit, detecting continuation packets as keyframes. Fixed to require BOTH S=1 (start of partition) AND frame_type=0.
     3. **No keyframe cache**: Added keyframe caching - collect packets from keyframe start until marker=true, store in cache, send to new subscribers immediately.
   - **Files Changed**:
     - `lib/src/peer_connection.dart` - Added `_absSendTimeExtensionId`, `_twccExtensionId` constants, set in `addTransceiver()`
     - `lib/src/media/rtp_transceiver.dart` - Added `forwardCachedPackets()` method for sending cached keyframes
     - `example/mediachannel/pubsub/offer.dart` - VP8 keyframe detection and caching logic
   - **Result**: Video now plays (640x480) for subscribers - cached keyframe enables immediate decoding
   - **Test files**: `interop/automated/pubsub_test.mjs`

6. **Safari headless camera access** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED with canvas stream fallback
   - **Root Cause**: Safari/WebKit headless mode always denies `getUserMedia()` permission
   - **The Bug**: Unlike Chrome (which has `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`) and Firefox (which has `firefoxUserPrefs`), Safari has no way to grant camera permission in headless mode. The `grantPermissions(['camera'])` API throws "Unknown permission: camera".
   - **Investigation**: Tested various approaches:
     - `headless: false` with fake streams - still prompts for permission
     - `grantPermissions(['camera'])` - not supported by WebKit
     - `about:blank` with inline JS - not a secure context
   - **Solution**: Use `canvas.captureStream()` as fallback when `getUserMedia()` fails
     - Canvas API works without permissions in all modes
     - `captureStream(30)` produces a valid MediaStream at 30fps
     - Animated canvas provides varied video content for testing
   - **Files Changed**: 30 server files in `interop/automated/` - added `createCanvasStream()` helper and fallback logic
   - **Result**: All Safari media tests now pass in headless mode
   - **Commits**:
     - `5830dd9` - Fix Firefox headless camera access (firefoxUserPrefs at launch time)
     - `9b41c90` - Add canvas stream fallback for Safari headless camera access

7. **Multi-client tests timeout in run_all_tests.sh** (FIXED Dec 2025)
   - **Status**: RESOLVED
   - **Original Symptom**: 3 tests timeout when run via `./run_all_tests.sh chrome`
   - **Root Causes Found**:
     - `multi_client_sendonly`: FFmpeg started before clients connected, causing keyframe miss
     - `multi_client_sendrecv`: Browser candidate polling loop blocked createClient() from returning
   - **Fixes Applied**:
     - `multi_client_sendonly_server.dart`: Start FFmpeg when first client connects (not at /start)
     - `multi_client_sendrecv_server.dart`: Early exit from candidate loop when already connected
     - `multi_client_sendrecv_test.mjs`: Increased timeout from 50s to 90s
   - **Result**: All 4 multi_client tests now pass:
     - `multi_client` - PASS
     - `multi_client_sendonly` - PASS (618 frames)
     - `multi_client_recvonly` - PASS
     - `multi_client_sendrecv` - PASS (110 echo frames)

8. **Test cleanup improvements** (Dec 2025)
   - **Orphaned ffmpeg processes**: When Dart server killed with SIGKILL, ffmpeg from sendonly tests kept running at high CPU
     - **Fix**: Added ffmpeg cleanup to `run_test.sh`, `run_debug_test.sh`, and `stop_test.sh`
     - Kills processes matching `ffmpeg.*testsrc` pattern
   - **Accumulated recording files**: Tests creating `recording-*.webm` files in project root
     - **Tests affected**: save_to_disk (8 variants), rtx, simulcast, twcc (12 servers total)
     - **Fix**: Auto-cleanup of recording files created during test run (only on success)
     - **Manual cleanup**: `./stop_test.sh --clean-recordings` removes all old recordings
